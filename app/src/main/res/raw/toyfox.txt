Originally created as smaller versions of their larger Smooth Fox Terrier dog breed ancestors, Toy Fox Terriers have been used for a variety of tasks, serving as ratters on farms and as hunters of small game such as squirrel. They have been successful circus dogs and performers and their intelligence helps them to do well in obedience and agility competitions. Their most important purpose, however, is to be a loyal, loving, and devoted companion that amuses and entertains their families.
