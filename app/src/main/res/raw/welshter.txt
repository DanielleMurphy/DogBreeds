The Welsh Terrier dog breed's zest for life is contagious, and he always enjoys himself to the fullest. Bred to hunt independently, with all the self-determination and intelligence that entails, the happy and lively Welshie rarely gets tired and wants to spend his days having fun, fun, fun. His joy, his attitude, and his brains all add up to one wonderful package: He's a true Terrier.
